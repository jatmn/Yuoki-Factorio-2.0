# Pullfrog owner commands

Pullfrog runs only after **jatmn** creates a new top-level issue or PR comment
whose first line begins with `@pullfrog` and a visible instruction:

```text
@pullfrog review this PR and report actionable defects
```

Other commenters, passive or quoted mentions, bare mentions, edited comments,
inline review comments and workflow reruns cannot run the agent. Post a new
command to retry. The workflow checks GitHub's actor identity and jatmn's account
ID, `12479882`, then checks out the trusted default branch. The Python helper
verifies the repository, event and original comment before the agent receives
credentials. The verified owner role lets commands manage contributor-created
issues and PRs too.

This follows the working setup in
[yuoki-quinityn](https://github.com/jatmn/yuoki-quinityn/blob/3be55808903e820839cdd515c9ef8c79f036e327/docs/pullfrog.md).
Opening a PR does not launch Pullfrog. Its agent workflow has no PR, push,
schedule or `workflow_dispatch` trigger. The separate **Pullfrog checks**
workflow only runs authorization tests and workflow validation.

## Account and repository setup

1. Give the existing Pullfrog GitHub App installation access to
   `jatmn/Yuoki-Factorio-2.x` and open its
   [repository console](https://pullfrog.com/console/jatmn?repo=Yuoki-Factorio-2.x).
   Use BYOK billing and the ChatGPT Codex subscription already connected to the
   `jatmn` account. No new GitHub provider secret is needed. To reconnect that
   account credential when necessary, use `npx pullfrog auth codex --org jatmn`;
   see [subscription setup](https://docs.pullfrog.com/codex-auth).
2. Keep managed mentions, automatic reviews/re-reviews, issue processing,
   review responses, CI autofix, labels, automatic approvals and auto-merge off.
   Keep non-collaborator triggers off. Keep pushes and shell access restricted.
3. Merge the reviewed workflow PR to `main`. If the console still shows
   **Needs setup**, use **Verify manual installation**. Leave **Add workflow
   directly** untouched: this repository supplies its own owner-command workflow.
4. Post a new owner command to verify a live run, for example:

   ```text
   @pullfrog read README.md and summarize this repository in one sentence. Do not modify files or create a PR.
   ```

The workflow selects `openai/gpt-sol`, as in the reference repository. It allows
feature-branch pushes, blocks default-branch/tag pushes and branch deletion,
and uses restricted shell access. Subscription credentials remain in Pullfrog's
encrypted store. A matching provider API key stored there can be a fallback
when subscription quota is exhausted; omit that fallback if API billing is
unwanted. Native status/verdict checks apply only to explicitly requested PR
commands, with `review.status-check` and `review.approval-check` enabled in the
console; they do not turn on automatic reviews or approving reviews.

## Maintenance and checks

The action bootstrap is pinned to Pullfrog v0.1.97; its npm runtime accepts
compatible 0.1.x updates. Keep `PULLFROG_VERSION` in the helper aligned with the
bootstrap and verify the upstream payload contract when updating it. Large
commands use the original GitHub event snapshot on the same runner, preserving
the authorized comment even if it is subsequently edited on GitHub.

```sh
python3 tools/test_pullfrog_command.py
actionlint
git diff --check
```
